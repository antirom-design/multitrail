# About Multitrail

**Multitrail** is a collaborative drawing playground where ephemeral trails come alive.

Draw together in real-time with friends, colleagues, or strangers. Your strokes appear on everyone's canvas instantly, creating a shared visual conversation that fades into nothing after a few seconds.

No accounts. No saving. Just connect, draw, and disappear.

## What makes it special

- **Ephemeral by design** - Everything you draw vanishes. There's freedom in impermanence.
- **Truly real-time** - See cursors move, watch strokes appear as they're drawn.
- **Zero friction** - Share a 6-character code or scan a QR. That's it.
- **Expressive tools** - Speed-sensitive brushes, text typing, customizable colors and styles.

## Use cases

- Remote whiteboarding sessions
- Collaborative brainstorming
- Playful group doodling
- Visual communication without words
- Teaching and demonstrating concepts
